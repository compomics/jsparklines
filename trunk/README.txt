    JSparklines
   =============

   JSparklines makes it straightforward to visualize numbers in Java 
   tables by the use of sparklines. 

   All that is needed is a couple of lines of code. 

   The charts are created using JFreeChart and added to the table 
   columns using custom TableCellRenderers. 

   Two main types of charts are currently supported: bar charts and 
   line charts. The colors and the plot orientation is set when creating 
   the sparklines.
