    JSparklines
   =============

   JSparklines makes it straightforward to visualize numbers in Java 
   tables by the use of sparklines. 

   All that is needed is a couple of lines of code. 

   The charts are created using JFreeChart and added to the table 
   columns using custom TableCellRenderers. 

   More than 27 types of charts/renderers are supported!
